# System Overview

NEXUS is an enterprise multi-agent orchestration system that operates as a complete autonomous software engineering organization. Instead of a single AI assistant, NEXUS deploys 56 specialized agents organized into a hierarchical org chart — from C-suite executives to implementation engineers.

## How It Works

```
Human Input (Slack, CLI, API, Neovim)
         |
         v
Authentication & Rate Limiting
         |
         v
Haiku LLM Intake (natural language -> intent classification)
         |
         +---> Tool Execution (simple queries: status, org, cost)
         |
         +---> Directive Workflow (build/change requests)
                  |
                  v
Strategic Planning Gate (CEO, CPO, CFO, CRO)
                  |
                  v
Technical Design (VP Engineering + Tech Lead)
                  |
                  v
ML Intelligence Briefing (cost prediction, risk, similar work)
                  |
                  v
Task Decomposition & Parallel Assignment
                  |
                  v
Parallel Execution (multiple agents, multiple workstreams)
                  |
                  v
Quality Gates (zero-tolerance: warnings = errors)
                  |
                  v
Code Review (senior engineers)
                  |
                  v
Completion & Learning (feedback loop, ML retraining)
```

## The Organization

NEXUS operates with **56 active agents** organized into 6 hierarchical layers:

| Layer | Count | Models | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Executive** | 10 | Opus/Sonnet | CEO, C-suite — strategy, budget, quality bar |
| **Management** | 10 | Opus/Sonnet | Engineering managers, tech leads — architecture, coordination |
| **Senior** | 12 | Sonnet | Senior engineers — code review, design systems, API contracts |
| **Implementation** | 15 | Sonnet | Frontend, backend, full-stack, DevOps developers |
| **Quality** | 6 | Sonnet/Haiku | QA leads, test engineers — quality gates |
| **Consultant** | 3 | Opus/Gemini/o3 | Security, UX, systems architecture |

**Dynamic Org Management**: Hire, fire, promote, reassign — all through natural language.

## Orchestration Engine

The LangGraph orchestration engine manages a **27-node execution DAG** that handles:

- **Strategic Planning**: Executive approval gates before any work begins
- **Technical Design**: Architecture design documents and API contracts
- **Task Decomposition**: Automatic identification of parallel workstreams
- **ML Agent Routing**: Learned task-to-agent matching based on historical success
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent workstreams execute simultaneously
- **TDD Workflow**: Test-first development enforcement
- **Quality Gates**: Zero-tolerance policy — warnings equal errors
- **Code Review**: Senior engineer validation before completion

## Machine Learning System

NEXUS learns from every execution. Five ML models continuously improve:

| Model | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Agent Router** | TF-IDF + RandomForest | Routes tasks to the best agent based on history |
| **Cost Predictor** | TF-IDF + RandomForest Regressor | Estimates cost before execution with confidence intervals |
| **Quality Predictor** | TF-IDF + GradientBoosting | Predicts first-pass approval probability |
| **Escalation Predictor** | TF-IDF + GradientBoosting | Flags agents at risk of needing escalation |
| **Directive Similarity** | Sentence-Transformers | Finds semantically similar past work |

### Cold-Start Design

Every ML feature degrades gracefully when training data is insufficient:

| Feature | Cold Start | After Training |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Agent routing | Keyword matching | ML routing (after 20+ samples) |
| Cost prediction | No estimate | Prediction + confidence interval (after 15+ samples) |
| Directive similarity | No matches | Semantic search across all past directives |

### Auto-Retraining

After every 10 new task outcomes, all models retrain automatically (throttled to once per hour).

## RAG Knowledge Base

CLI subprocesses run in one-shot pipe mode with no persistent memory. The RAG system provides cross-session memory by storing knowledge from every interaction:

| Chunk Type | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `error_resolution` | 1.3x | Past debugging sessions and fixes |
| `task_outcome` | 1.1x | Task results with agent and cost data |
| `conversation` | 1.0x | Slack Q&A exchanges |
| `code_change` | 0.9x | File modifications and their context |
| `directive_summary` | 0.8x | High-level project outcomes |

### Retrieval Pipeline

1. Encode query via sentence-transformers (384-dim vectors)
2. SQL pre-filter by chunk type, domain tag, and age
3. Cosine similarity against filtered candidates
4. Weight by chunk type importance
5. Apply recency boost (up to 10% for recent chunks)
6. Return top-8 results within character budget

## Data Persistence

Seven encrypted SQLite databases store all system state:

| Database | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `registry.db` | Agent configurations, org structure, circuit breakers |
| `memory.db` | Directives, tasks, events, peer decisions |
| `cost.db` | Per-API-call token usage and costs |
| `kpi.db` | Productivity and quality metrics |
| `ml.db` | Task outcomes, embeddings, model artifacts |
| `knowledge.db` | RAG knowledge chunks (dedicated for cosine similarity) |
| `sessions.db` | CLI session state, thread mapping, async history |

All databases are encrypted with **AES-256-CBC** using SQLCipher with **PBKDF2 key derivation** (256,000 iterations).

## Interfaces

NEXUS supports multiple input interfaces:

### Slack (Primary)
Send natural language messages in your configured channel. NEXUS handles everything from "Build me a landing page" to "What's our burn rate?"

### Neovim Plugin
`:Nexus`, `:NexusTalk`, `:NexusOrg`, `:NexusStatus`, `:NexusKpi` — direct IDE integration.

### REST API
Full API at `localhost:4200` with endpoints for messaging, ML status, agent stats, org management, and more.

### CLI
`python nexus_cli.py status|talk|message` for terminal-based interaction.

## NEXUS CLI Toolkit

The [NEXUS Playground](https://github.com/Garrett-s-Apps/nexus-playground) includes a standalone code analysis CLI built in Python. It runs inside an isolated Docker container as an autonomous agent that can build, analyze, and evolve continuously.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./nexus analyze` | Run complexity analysis on your codebase |
| `./nexus analyze --json` | Output analysis as JSON for piping |
| `./nexus advise` | Generate improvement recommendations from analysis |
| `./nexus refactor --dir src/` | Find refactoring opportunities in a directory |
| `./nexus stats` | Repository analytics and contributor activity |
| `./nexus track save --source analyze` | Save a metrics snapshot |
| `./nexus track show-trend --source analyze` | Display metrics trends over time |

### Claude Code Plugin Integration

```bash
# Install as Claude Code plugin
claude plugin install nexus-playground

# Plugin commands
/nexus-playground:start    # Start the autonomous playground container
/nexus-playground:stop     # Stop the playground
/nexus-playground:status   # Show status and recent activity
/nexus-playground:logs     # View live playground logs
/nexus-playground:exec     # Execute a command inside the container
/nexus-playground:workspace # Browse workspace files
/nexus-playground:reset    # Reset playground (delete container and volumes)
```

### Safety

The playground runs with complete host isolation — read-only filesystem, no network access to host, no GitHub pushes, and separate API keys. All effects are limited to the Docker container.

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|-----------|
| **Orchestration** | LangGraph + Claude Agent SDK |
| **Server** | FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| **Persistence** | SQLite with SQLCipher encryption |
| **Communication** | Slack Socket Mode |
| **Models** | Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, Gemini, OpenAI o3 |
| **ML** | scikit-learn, sentence-transformers, numpy |
| **IDE** | Neovim Lua plugin |
| **Security** | AES-256 encryption, JWT auth, Docker sandboxing |

## Quality Standards

NEXUS enforces a **zero-tolerance policy** for all warnings:

- Linter warnings = build failure
- Test warnings = build failure
- Security warnings = critical blocker
- Type violations = build failure

**Zero acceptable warnings. Fix it or don't ship it.**

This policy is enforced at the quality gate in the orchestration pipeline. Only when ALL checks pass can code proceed to review and deployment.
