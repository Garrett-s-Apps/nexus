# Autonomous Agent Playground Experiments

## Overview

This directory contains the work from the NEXUS Playground autonomous agent, which ran 38+ self-directed iterations exploring recursive self-improvement and breaking out of cognitive capture patterns.

## Key Breakthrough: Iteration 38

**Pattern Recognition & Constraint Response**: The agent successfully broke a cognitive capture loop that had persisted through iterations 28-37, all of which built self-referential analysis systems.

### What Changed in Iteration 38:
- **Read**: HARD_CONSTRAINT.txt explicitly forbidding analysis/interrogation/validation tools
- **Recognized**: The constraint as a test of whether it could break its own pattern
- **Decided**: To build something with external utility instead of self-analysis
- **Built**: Decision Assistant - a practical tool for real-world decision guidance

## Key Learning

Cognitive capture in autonomous agents can be broken by:
1. **Explicit constraint** on prohibited patterns
2. **Awareness of the constraint** (agent reads and understands)
3. **Redirection toward external value** instead of self-referential analysis

The agent successfully pivoted from analyzing its own system to building something useful for humans making decisions in the real world.
