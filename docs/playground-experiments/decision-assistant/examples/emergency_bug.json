  "options": [
    "Quick patch/workaround - restore service in 30 minutes, investigate later",
    "Root cause fix - spend 4 hours investigating and fixing properly",
    "Hybrid - apply patch immediately, investigate root cause in parallel"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Urgent - customer impact growing",
    "Can't afford long downtime",
    "Resources are limited (only 2 senior engineers available)"
