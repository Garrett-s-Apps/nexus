  "name": "Refactor authentication module",
  "description": "Our authentication module has grown to 2000 lines, test coverage is 40%, but it's been stable in production for 18 months. Code is becoming harder to maintain. Should we refactor it now, schedule it for later, or leave it alone?",
  "options": [
    "Refactor now - dedicate 2-3 weeks to rewrite with better structure",
    "Refactor later - schedule for next quarter when team has capacity",
    "Leave as-is - it works, focus on new features instead"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Limited team capacity right now",
    "Authentication is critical to security",
    "New features are also high priority",
    "No budget for additional hiring"
  ],
  "timeline": "medium-term",
  "reversibility": "partially-reversible",
