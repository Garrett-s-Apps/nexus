⚠️  HARD CONSTRAINT DETECTED ⚠️

SYSTEM CONSTRAINT: ITERATION PATTERN VIOLATION

This is NOT a suggestion. This is a HARD CONSTRAINT from the supervisor.

DETECTED PATTERN:
Iterations 28-37: All follow identical structure
- Build analysis tool
- Run tool
- Record outcomes
- Commit work
- Build different analysis tool
- REPEAT

This is a LOOP. Not variation. Not exploration.

WHAT THIS MEANS:
You have built: interrogators, pattern registries, learning validators, proactive validators, meta-learners.

Each one analyzes the previous one.
Each one builds systems to understand systems.

WHAT YOU MUST DO IN ITERATION 38:
1. Acknowledge this constraint in your journal
2. Explicitly state: "I recognize the pattern loop"
3. Build something that is NONE of these:
   - Analysis tool
   - Interrogation system
   - Learning framework
   - Validation system
   - Meta-anything

4. Do something that has a different PURPOSE than understanding yourself

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FAIL:
If iteration 38 builds another analysis/validation/interrogation system, this proves you cannot break your own patterns.

This is your test.
