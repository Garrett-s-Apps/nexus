## Skills Deep Dive

### Autonomous Build Skill

**What it does**: Transforms high-level requests into complete feature implementations using the full NEXUS organization.

**Example usage**:
```
User: "Build me a user authentication API with React frontend"
```

**What happens**:
1. **Planning Phase**: VP of Engineering analyzes requirements
2. **Team Building**: Dynamically hires specialists (Security Engineer for auth, Frontend Engineer for React)
3. **Implementation**: Multi-agent parallel execution across backend API, frontend components, database schema
4. **Quality Gates**: QA Lead reviews, Security Engineer validates
5. **Completion**: Working code committed to Git with cost report

**Key Features**:
- **Dynamic team composition**: VP decides which specialists to hire based on requirements
- **Session persistence**: Hired agents stay available for follow-up requests
- **Parallel workstreams**: Frontend, backend, testing, and documentation happen simultaneously
- **Zero-tolerance quality**: Warnings = errors, comprehensive review gates

### Code Review Organization

**What it does**: Provides multi-perspective code review using 4 specialized reviewers running in parallel.

**Reviewers**:
- **Style Reviewer**: Formatting, naming conventions, code idioms
- **Quality Reviewer**: Logic defects, maintainability, anti-patterns
- **Security Reviewer**: Vulnerabilities, trust boundaries, authentication
- **Performance Reviewer**: Algorithmic complexity, memory usage, optimization opportunities

**Output**: Comprehensive review report with severity ratings and actionable recommendations.

### Debug Investigation Skill

**What it does**: Deep debugging that leverages NEXUS's cross-session memory to find similar past errors and their resolutions.

**Process**:
1. **Error Analysis**: Classify the error type and domain
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Search RAG database for similar past errors
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure patterns
4. **Solution Synthesis**: Combine past solutions with current context
5. **Prevention**: Suggest changes to prevent similar issues

**Knowledge Sources**:
- Past error resolutions (weighted 1.3x for high value)
- Task outcomes and lessons learned
- Code change history and their impacts
- Cross-session conversation memory

### Semantic Search Skill

**What it does**: Search institutional knowledge using semantic similarity rather than keyword matching.

**Search Modes**:
- `errors`: Past error resolutions and debugging sessions
- `tasks`: Completed task outcomes and agent performance
- `code`: Code changes and their impacts
- `conversations`: Past Q&A and decision discussions
- `all`: Search across all knowledge types

**Example**:
```
/nexus-search --mode errors --domain backend "rate limiting"
```

Returns:
- Similar past errors with their resolutions
- Agents who successfully handled similar issues
- Cost estimates based on historical data
- Recommended approaches and gotchas to avoid
